# 🔗 Decentralized identity & Login system (DID + ZKP)  

## 📖 Overview  
This project is a **cloud-ready, environment-secured decentralized identity management system**.  
It enables organizations to register and authenticate users using cryptographically secure **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**, with all secrets, credentials, and configuration handled via environment variables.  

Leveraging **MongoDB Atlas** for scalable storage, it features:  
- Enterprise-level security  
- Optional encryption  
- Zero-knowledge proof login  
- Comprehensive audit logging  

Designed for **privacy, security, and flexible global deployment**, it is ideal for organizations seeking a robust and production-ready digital identity platform.

## ✨ Features  
- 🔐 **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** Register, store, and manage DIDs with full cryptographic security.  
- 🛡️ **Zero-Knowledge Authentication:** Passwordless login using ECDSA/Schnorr-based zero-knowledge proofs.  
- ☁️ **Cloud-Ready & Scalable:** Supports **MongoDB Atlas** for global reach or local MongoDB for private environments.  
- 🏢 **Enterprise Security:** Public key encryption, secure credential management, brute-force protection, and session timeouts.  
- 📊 **Comprehensive Logging & Analytics:** Complete audit logs and interactive dashboards for system activity.  
- 👤 **User Privacy:** Private keys are never stored; users download and manage them locally upon registration.

## 🛠️ Usage  
1. **Register** → Create a new decentralized identity (DID) and download your private keys.  
2. **Login** → Authenticate securely using your DID and private key via zero-knowledge proof.  
3. **Dashboard** → View analytics, logs, and user statistics.
